Various example Aetherling pipelines live here. They're just pipelines without 
any main program to simulate or compile them. 
You can import pipelines from here and do interesting things with them yourself.

See src/AppMains for main functions that can run some of the examples from
the command line. Due to the Stack tool used, each main must be in its own
folder.
