Various example Aetherling pipelines live here. Except SimpleExamples, they're 
just pipelines without any main program to simulate or compile them. 
You can import pipelines from here and do interesting things with them yourself.
Main.hs runs the SimpleExamples and Main.output is the output of them, provided
so that viewers on Github can see the output without running the code 
themselves.
